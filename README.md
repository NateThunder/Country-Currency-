# 🌍 Country Currency

## 🎯 About
This program allows the user to enter the country of their choice. The program will return what currency they use.

This program is an exercise in using the `match` and `case` function.

## 🛠️ How It Works
- The user inputs the name of a country.
- The program checks the country and returns its corresponding currency.
- If the country is not found, the user is encouraged to propose an update.

## ✏️ Contributing
If I have missed out a country, please let me know and I will update it. You can also propose an update! 😊
